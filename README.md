# CombatStats-Docs
Documentation for CombatStats
All documentation is written in Markdown and parsed with [Parsedown](http://parsedown.org).

## To GitHub user reading this
This is a Bukkit plugin, this specific repo contains documentation for the plugin. I didn't know if I wanted to write out a massive Spigot page so I thought it would be better to put it on a proper site.

## Contributing
You are welcome to contribute but please proof-read before submitting a pull request.

## Getting the plugin
The plugin is (as of now) private, I am planning to release it on Spigot forums (resources section) in the near future. I am debating if I should make it premium only or public.
I have put a lot of time and effort into the plugin.
