### To GitHub user reading this
This is the documentation for a Bukkit plugin, this repo contains documentation for the plugin including API and Configuration help. I didn't know if I wanted to write out a massive Spigot page so I thought it would be better to put it on a proper site.

### Getting the plugin
The plugin is (as of now) private, I am planning to release it on Spigot forums (resources section) in the near future. I am debating if I should make it premium only or public.
I have put a lot of time and effort into the plugin.
