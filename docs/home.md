**CombatStats is a powerful stats plugin, capable of logging almost anything within a Minecraft server via its API.**

## Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#intro)
- [Config](/config)
- [API](/api)

By default it has the following statistics (all toggleable via config)

- Player Kills
- Mob Kills
- Deaths
- Projectiles Launched
- Highest Player Killstreak
- Blocks Broken
- Blocks Placed
- Items Crafted
- Total play time

Again, all of the stats listed above can be disabled or enabled at your own discretion using the config. If you have a suggestion please let me know and I will try to add it.
You are not limited to me though on what you can do this with plugin, you can use the plugin's API to add your own stats (see [API docs](/api) for more info)
