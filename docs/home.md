<span id="intro"></span>**Looking for a way to find the richest player, or want to find out who is your most loyal player? This is the plugin for you! CombatStats is a powerful stats plugin, capable of logging almost anything within a Minecraft server via its API.**

Out of the box this plugin can log many things about players that join your server, if you want more you can browse [add-ons](/addons) created using the developer API or create something yourself!

## Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#intro)
- [Config](/config)
- [Storage Methods](/storage)
- [Developers API](/api)
- [Permissions](#permissions)
- [Addons (Coming Soon)](/addons)
- [Web Interface (Coming Soon)](/web-interface)

### By default it has the following statistics (all toggleable via config)

- Player Kills
- Mob Kills
- Deaths
- Projectiles Launched
- Highest Player Killstreak
- Blocks Broken
- Blocks Placed
- Items Crafted
- Total play time

Again, all of the stats listed above can be disabled or enabled at your own discretion using [the config](/config). If you have a suggestion please let me know and I will try to add it.
You are not limited by me though on what you can do this with plugin, you can use the plugin's API to add your own stats (see [API docs](/api) for more info).

<hr>
## <span id="permissions">Permissions</span>
There are no permissions in the current version. Every player that joins the server will be tracked by the plugin, however you can vote for permissions support in [this poll](http://poll.pw/475)
